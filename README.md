# How to Run:

1. Establish a connection with MySQL\
  1b. I use [XAMPP Control Panel](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
        run XAMPP, start MySQL
    1c. To see DBs in browser, also start Apache, and then click "Admin" for MySQL
2. Make sure that your MySQL password and the one in line 26 of database.py match (or else connection will fail)
